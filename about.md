Pianote is a piano learning device. It is geared toward learning new pieces of music and beginner piano players. By changing the way the notes are represented, users will get a feel for how each piece should be played. The notes are represented as falling objects that will be displayed on a screen, that hit the actual piano key when that note is supposed to be played. Also by gamifying the learning process, users will feel more motivated about playing the piano.

## Pianote Features

* Alternative, easier to read note representation
* Upload any midi to play along to
* Will connect to any MIDI enabled keyboard
* Practice mode where the software will wait for correct input before proceeding.
